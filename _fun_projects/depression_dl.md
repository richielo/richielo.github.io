  We trained two separate models for Chinese and English data. We compared our proposed model with vanilla neural networks and support vector machines. Illustrative examples are provided below that showcase how our model identifies depressive sentiments. See the <a href = "https://github.com/richielo/depression_classifiers">Github Repo</a> for details.
